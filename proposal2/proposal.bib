I read the following paper and wanted to share it with you as it's interesting and may be relevant for TP:
[1] M. Bilenko and M. Richardson, ``Predictive client-side profiles for personalized advertising,'' presented at the KDD '11: Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, 2011.

1) interesting empirical illustrative result:
Demonstrates the presence of a "conversion lift": clear  increase in positive response to an ad for users who *recently* seen or clicked a related keyword. 
Similarly, there is a conversion drop in response to ad for users who have seen a related keyword in their search/browsing only a long time ago. 

This motivates advertisers to increment/decrement their bids given information about the users like the time elapsed since a previous exposure to this keyword. The is the first time I see such temporal effects presented and discussed.

2) Proposes an approach to "user profiling" based on submodular utility. Basically this is the equivalent of our "intent" function for a CPC with keyword-based choices of bid increment. So it might be interesting to extend our model to this case.

In this case "profiling" means selecting a small subset of keywords that are appropriate for an "increment bid". The main result is to select the best subset (the one maximizing the chance to see a revenue increase). 

With a few assumptions: 
- advertisers already made up their mind and have a specified "bid increment" per keyword k. not sure how, simulations use a fixed 25% increase.
- CTR for an ad and probability to observe a given context query is known (using people who did not opt-out of tracking + some learning algorithms).
- knowledge of connections between keywords to see overlaps between ads

Then the paper shows that it becomes a simple budgeted maximum coverage that is submodular (i.e., adding a keyword is good but it may be less useful if you already have a keyword that generates a bid increment for this ad), so it can be efficiently approximate within (1-1/e) of the optimal.

Keeping a set of keyword that are relevant, according to previous context seen. 

3) Moreover, this method is "private". I put quotation mark because the user is still identified and logged, but the techniques is online, and can be updated, with all information kept in the user. So if you trust the server side for actually erasing this information, your tracking disappear while the targeting can still be made. 

4) The validation is quite hard to follow (use a massive data set of bing with a lot of tricks and very poor description of the different features). But roughly speaking it is encouraging, showing that even in an online way, you can hope to redeem the majority of revenue (97% in that case) with this online approach that does not require full historical data (but still allows a malicious server to do so). Interpreting this number is a bit tricky since an added feature (just keeping the k-most recent query) is already bringing most of the improvement, and all methods have significant but modest performance. At least it's not awful. It also points to a similar "diminishing return" property where only a few data about everybody is useful, and increasing gain are negligible given those.}

  abstract = {A range of applications, from predicting the spread of human and electronic viruses to city planning and resource management in mobile communications, depend on our ability to foresee the whereabouts and mobility of individuals, raising a fundamental question: To what degree is human behavior predictable? Here we explore the limits of predictability in human dynamics by studying the mobility patterns of anonymized mobile phone users. By measuring the entropy of each individual's trajectory, we find a 93% potential predictability in user mobility across the whole user base. Despite the significant differences in the travel patterns, we find a remarkable lack of variability in predictability, which is largely independent of the distance users cover on a regular basis.
