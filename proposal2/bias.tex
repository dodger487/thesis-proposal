% Chris Notes: What am I trying to say in this section?
%   We show a methodology to attach location data to demographics
%   Segregation stuff / mobility description: what to say?
%   Location can be used to infer demographics


% From countries, states, and regions to neighborhoods, local meeting houses, or churches, the places we live and visit are tightly connected to our identities.
% Location information gathered about an individual over time can reveal much more than a home location.
% In fact, patterns in human mobility can reveal more private components of an individual's 
% blah, such as their race, gender, or economic status.

% In this section, I will discuss two works which explore these issues.
% Both rely on a dataset connecting images to mobility through geotagged photos on the image-sharing site Instagram.
% In the first, we label faces for gender, race, and other attributes, and explore whether these features can be inferred from locations visited.
% In the second, we evaluate the use computational vision techniques to scale up the use of Instagram to connect mobility to demographics for an ``automated census".
