% Algorithmic bias is bad
% Recent work has been more about theory, less about real data analysis
% I have a cool new dataset that allows me to do data analysis

As described in \chap{sec:bias}, an important challenge facing the computer science community is algorithmic bias.
In recent years, an emerging body of work has focused on different mitigating techniques, 
  such as automated discovery of bias, ``de-biasing" existing algorithms, or theoretical analyses of differnet types of bias.
De-biasing techniques are sure to incur a cost: the objective function of the algorithm is no longer as straightforward, and organizationally new infrastructure needs to be put into place for something that could hurt revenue.
Understanding the key trade-offs between revenue and uncertain risk will be important to insure real-world adoption.
Although there have been some good initial insights, the community has lacked strong data-driven analysis on this trade off.

I propose to fill this gap by applying proposed techniques to real-world problems through the use of an innovative dataset.
Namely, I will look at the real-world problems of recommendation systems within a large social network.
I will examine the trade off between recommendation accuracy, bias, and revenue.

Over the course of several months I have gathered photo metadata from the popular image-sharing application Instagram.
I have run these photos through a program that recognizes faces within each image, tagging it with age, gender, and ethnicity.
This will create the largest publicly available dataset that I know of connecting human mobility to demographics.

Machine learning systems utilize location in making recommendations.
However, location can be highly correlated with potentially sensitive traits, such as ethnicity.
I plan to look at 


The project will emerge in several stages.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Collection of instagram data (completed).
  \item Labeling of instagram data with Face++ API (completed).
  \item Initial analysis and descriptive statistics of dataset (in progress).
  \item Full problem specificiation: algorithms, inputs, and objectives.
  \item Apply de-biasing to algorithms and analyze impacts.
  \item Create recommendations for algorithm designers.
\end{enumerate}
